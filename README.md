I created this project as a way for football fans to easily find the injury risks for their favorite players. The main features of my project are the dropdown menus to easily search for a player, and then the table that is generated once the parameters for searching a player are met. The table includes the player's name, season injury risk, and their team. To incoroporate the data into my code, I used an online database and manually added almost every player in the database into the code. I then had to translate the data from Python into JavaScript in order to make it connect to the front end.
